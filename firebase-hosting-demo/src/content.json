It's been a bit odd to start my career during the pandemic, but the unique challenges that came with that have taught me things I wouldn't have expected.",
            "playing the guitar; reading - especially about social action and topics adjacent to the field I love most (don't tell anyone, but it's computer related); I have some weird obsession with water, its sports, particularily those I'm terrible at. Like rowing with the UdeM's team, it's pretty fun to scream synchronously with a bunch of charismatic strangers while desperately trying not to tip over.",
            "and communicating science; I've met all kinds of people throughout my life and our different tastes, talents, experience, backgrounds, handicaps and challenges have taught me more than I could ever repay. I feel like by teaching, I pay back just a bit of that debt."
